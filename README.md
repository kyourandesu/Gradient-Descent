# Gradient-Descent
A project find out more about gradient descent.

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function. Gradient descent in machine learning is simply used to find the values of a function's parameters (coefficients) that minimize a cost function as far as possible.
Gradient descent can also be used with atleast 2 variables.
